## khenz-tiktokbot

khenz-tiktokbot is a simple and easy to mod bot that automatically generates and posts videos to tiktok.

## Installation

Here is a list of software that the script requires:
1. FireFox
2. geckodriver (you need to put it in `geckodriver_stuff/`)
3. FFmpeg
4. Python
5. Python packages (they're frozen in `requirements.txt`)
6. imagemagick
7. A reddit's API app

## Usage

After installing everything needed, you have to place a ~9 minutes long video in `videos/video.webm`; then run `browsersetup.py`, accept the cookies, log onto your tiktok account and finally close FireFox. After logging in, run `browsertest.py`, if you're logged in, then you shall be all setup :)

Now you can execute `main.py` to generate and post videos.

You can also edit a couple of things (such as the font color, font, fontsize, NSFW setting, etc..) in `main.py` :).
