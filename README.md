## Installation
Here is the list of software that the script requires:

3. FFmpeg
4. Python
5. The python packages (all of them are located in the requirements.txt)
6. imagemagick

## Usage
After installing everything needed you have to run the browsersetup.py, accept the cookies, login onto your tiktok account and then close FireFox. After logging in run browsertest.py, if are logged in, then you shall be all setup :)
